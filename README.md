# demo-fvttdev-module
Provides a demo of using `fvttdev`, a zero config CLI, to bundle a module for Foundry VTT

Please note that `fvttdev` is presently in pre-alpha though has been released and this repo shows essential usage for the `bundle` command. In short the `fvttdev` bundle command captures all of the functionality configured in [demo-rollup-module](https://github.com/typhonjs-fvtt/demo-rollup-module) with several additions like Typescript support and Babel for transformation of the latest JS 2020 code.
